	//this class is to help us control the bugs (insects) and their behavior in game.

	// as the player gets close to them. They should then be deleted if eaten and 
	// the player's score should increase.

		//place bug randomly in generated tunnel
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
		//make bug fly around (play animation frames?)
